  KIDS

  When they first show up, you will experience a love that's even deeper than you had known so far;

  As they grow up, they will give you a different perspective on everything you took for granted;

  Through life, they will take you through a whole range of emotions -

    this is where you can reveal yourself as the best example for them to follow;

  And in the end, they will be the BEST thing that ever happened to you!
