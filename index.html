  <p> When they first show up, you will experience a love that's even deeper than you had known so far; </p>

  <p> As they grow up, they will give you a different perspective on everything you took for granted; </p>

  <p> Through life, they will take you across a whole range of emotions -  </p>

  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  this is where you can reveal yourself as the best example for them to follow;  </p>

  <p> And in the end, they will be the BEST thing that ever happened to you!  </p>
